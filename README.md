Chrome's Dev Console remembers everything you type, including mistakes and typos. This results in a polluted list of suggestions. This was very annoying to me, and I began to search for a remedy. As it turns out, the remedy is non-trivial. But while clicking through the menus I stumbled onto the [creativelab5.com](https://creativelab5.com)'s [localstorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) entry.

Pretty-printing the contents of the 'boardStates' key reveals interesting information. It is a JSON data structure, and the names of various elements suggests that it represents the animation. For example, [this](https://github.com/goeiebook/creativelab/blob/master/json/defaultBoardStates.json) is the default page shown at startup. 

The 'shapes' key is where the most interesting details are. Here are keyframes, stroke and fill parameters, point coordinates, and things called 'handles'. A lot of information, but this is exciting. Perhaps there is a way to create an animation using tools other than those provided by the CreativeLab5 application.


```json
{
    "shapes": [
        {
            "break": false,
            "duped": false,
            "fillColor": "#4285f4",
            "hierarchyIndex": null,
            "isLine": false,
            "keyframes": [
                {
                    "ease": "easeInOutExpo",
                    "fillColor": "#4285f4",
                    "handlesMoved": true,
                    "state": {
                        "handleIn": [
                            [
                                "Point",
                                16.9011,
                                6.97627
                            ],
                        ],
                        "handleOut": [
                            [
                                "Point",
                                -16.9011,
                                -6.97627
                            ],
                        ],
                        "point": [
                            [
                                "Point",
                                456.21216,
                                287.17157
                            ],
                        ]
                    },
                    "strokeColor": "#4285f4",
                    "strokeWidth": 1,
                    "time": 0
                }
            ],
            "numSides": 8,
            "strokeColor": "#4285f4",
            "strokeWidth": 1
        }
        
    ]
}

```

A good first step is to try and reduce complexity. [This JSON structure](https://github.com/goeiebook/creativelab/blob/master/json/simple.json), for example, removes all shapes from the default page except for the abstract 'G'. I pasted this string into the localstorage field, reloaded the page, and clicked the 'Continue' button.

That's exciting.
