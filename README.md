Chrome's Dev Console remembers everything you type, including mistakes and typos. This results in a polluted list of suggestions. This was very annoying to me, and I began to search for a remedy. It turns our the remedy is non-trivial, but while clicking through the menus I stumbled onto the [creativelab5.com](https://creativelab5.com)'s [localstorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) entry.

Pretty-printing the contents of the 'boardStates' key reveals interesting information. It appears to be JSON data structure with details about the animation. For example, [this](https://github.com/goeiebook/creativelab/blob/master/json/defaultBoardStates.json) is the default page shown at startup. 

The 'shapes' key is where the most interesting details are. Here are times, stroke and fill parameters, point coordinates, and things called 'handles'. There are a lot of parameters, but this is quite exciting. Perhaps there is a way to edit this data using tools other than those provided by the CreativeLab5 application.

```json
{
    "shapes": [
        {
            "break": false,
            "duped": false,

                        ]
